- No re-training required to add new faces.
- Usage is real time & offline.
- Attractive and simple UI & UX.

- Method 2- Run from Android Studio

Open the project in Android Studio. Connect your mobile device to your laptop using a cable. Press the 'Run' button on Android Studio to install and start the application on your device. It is not recommended to use the AVD emulator in Android Studio since it may cause issues due to the way the laptop's webcam integrates with the emulator software.

## Future scope

We can use Firebase for the data storage (which is done locally for now). We can also use Firebase Authentication for the admin login flow. A further QoE improvement that can be made is adding a feature so that clicking on the contact number sends the user directly to the contact app in their phone, with the number prefilled and ready to be dialled
